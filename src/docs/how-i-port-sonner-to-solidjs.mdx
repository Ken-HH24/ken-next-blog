[sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) is awesome as it provides good experience to user. And I wonder why not build a sonner for solid.js. Although there has been a [solid-sonner](https://github.com/wobsoriano/solid-sonner), I try to build it on my own and learn something from it.

## Start from the basic structure

My first goal is to build a `toast()` API, when I call it, a toast will fade in and fade out after specific duration.

[sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) uses a pub-sub design pattern to manage the toasts state. But in solid.js, thanks to the fine grained reactivity, it's easier for me to connect the data with UI.

I create a `ToastState` class which will use `createStore()` to get `[toasts, setToasts]` and manage the toast state change inside.

```ts
class ToastState {
  toasts: ToastT[]
  setToasts: SetStoreFunction<ToastT[]>

  constructor() {
    // use createStore to connect with UI
    const [toasts, setToasts] = createStore<ToastT[]>([])
    this.toasts = toasts
    this.setToasts = setToasts
  }

  addToast = (toast: ToastT) => {
    this.setToasts(
      produce((toasts) => {
        toasts.unshift(toast)
      }),
    )
  }

  updateToast = (id: string | number, data: Partial<ToastT>) => {
    // ... ...
  }

  createToast = (data: ExternalToast & { message?: string | JSXElement }) => {
    // ... ...
  }

  message = (message: string | JSXElement, data?: ExternalToast) => {
    this.createToast({ ...data, message })
  }

  // ... ...
}
```
